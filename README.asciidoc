Protocol overview
-----------------

DEVICES
~~~~~~~

Devices sends multipart message that MUST containt the following strings in
that exact order, on "METRICS" stream with topic "<what>.<name>" :

* name of the device
* what is being measured
* value

Device MUST send a message at regular intervals (at least every 10 second),
otherwise it is considered exploded.

Specific protocols are detailed in RFC blocks below.


COMPUTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~

The COMPUTATION peer offers a named service to any USER peers who request it.

The protocol consists of the following messages:
* GET/key - The USER peer requests a computed value for 'key' metric 
* key/value - The COMPUTATION peer returns the requested computed value for
  metric key.

Where "key" is a unique name for DEVICES metric, "value" is a string
representation of the value and "/" indicates a multipart message.

Parts
-----

* ups.c - Implements DEVICES protocol.
  Produces UPS metric data to METRICS stream.
* tnh.c - Implements. DEVICES protocol.
  Produces temperature, humidity metric data to METRICS stream
* comp.c - Implements COMPUTATION protocol.
** Offers 'STATS' service which computes current system status from METRICS
   stream.
** Offers 'average' service that computes total average value from METRICS
   stream. 
* ui.c - requests system status from 'STATS' services
